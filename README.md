## Wire frames
## White Board Photos

## Adobe XD Files

# Day One
Researched and studied using the Google Maps API(s) - https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud864
Finalized structure of database models/tables
Created production, development and test databases, models, migrated tables to my project.
Have basic google maps functionality on my app - next steps will be to finish planning out layout and structure of app, store data from the api in my production database.

# Day Two
Planned layout of web site pages
Completed wire frames and prototyping in Adobe XD - https://xd.adobe.com/view/09f60442-19ed-4bcd-69bc-4350ce2dbeaf-7fc7/

# Day Three
Planned site structure a bit more, which helped me realize I could combine some pages from my wire frames. Worked on some routes, wrote model associations, added more styling to site layout. Decided not to use express-ejs-layouts, doing header and footer in the partials folder so I can be more flexible with the site layout.

# Day Four
TODO: Finish routes, work on storing api data

# Day Five
TODO: Finish stuff! Stretch features?

# Weekend (Days Six/Seven)
TODO: Style the site more, finish whatever is left, work on stretch features
